Besides being the number on way to develop Android applications via the Android SDK, 
it is fully extensible to use languages such as Ruby, C, C++ and many many more.


Netbeans

The is the number one alternative to Eclipse. 
This program is extensible and free, and it compiles code which is a bonus.
When installing Netbeans it comes with a Java server called GlassFish that you could deploy on your computer for your testing environment. 
This server is the second biggest server for Java next to WebSphere (which is a whole different ball game).

Gedit is the official editor of the gnome desktop and comes installed once the system is setup.
Very useful for the user that is casually editing code and not undertaking major projects.
 This would be a good companion to Netbeans or Eclipse.
