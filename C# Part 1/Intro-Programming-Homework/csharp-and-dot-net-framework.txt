
.NET is an application development framework - it contains numerous libraries containing a range of functionality.
C# is a strong Object Oriented programming language that is mostly built on the .NET framework.
The .NET libraries can run on the CLR and thus any language which can run on the CLR can also use the .NET libraries.
In .NET you don't find only C#. You can find Visual Basic for example.
